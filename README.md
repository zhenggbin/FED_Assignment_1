# WCoMMs Website
My project involves developing on a telecommunication website for my own fictional company, WCoMMs. The primary objective is to effectively communicate the company's services to the customers. The website aims to be able to attract as many users as possible by showcasing of our various services and plans offered and also win the confidence of our customers regarding of our quality and reliability of the service provided.
 
## Design Process
The design process is to create a neat, organised and user-friendly website for the potential customers trying to seek enough information about the services provided and know better about the company. This website targets a very large group of audience, such as first-time users, individuals, family, friends and also even tourists as well. Our goal is to provide a very seamless experience for the users to better understand our services and encourage as many users as possible to sign up for our services.

User Stories:
1) As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate in the website so that I can find about the information of the services provided without experiencing much difficultes.
2) As a visitor with enquiries, I want to quickly find about the company's contact information so that I can reach out for help if needed.
3) As a prospective customer, I want to be able to understand the key features of each services provided so that it can help me to make a more informed choice of choosing the plan which better suits my needs.
